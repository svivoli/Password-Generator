# Password Generator

### Description

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that generates a random, secure password based on criteria inputted by the user. This is a useful tool for companies that deploy websites that host sensitive data so that their users can log in securely and ensure that their information is protected.

Components:
1. Password specification prompts:
  - Number of characters
  - Lowercase letters (yes/no)
  - Uppercase letters (yes/no)
  - Numbers (yes/no)
  - Special characters (yes/no)
2. Bootstrap jumbotron 
3. Responsive Bootstrap buttons
  - Generate password
  - Copy to clipboard
4. H1 titles
5. Textbox where generated password appears
6. Borders
7. Super cool background image

### My Experience

Difficulties:
* Generating a random password that pulls a specific # of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and symbol characters without simply repeating one character for each specification.

Overall, this project didn't present me with too much difficulty. The main challenge I faced was the one listed above. Once I was able to write a code that successfully generated a password, it first produced passwords that were randomizations of the same character for each specified criteria. These, as a result, were not very secure passwords. I was aiming for multiple random characters for each criteria in a random order. I was able to find a working code that produced exactly what I was looking for on google, after a few trial and errors. It was gratifying to produce a useful website that I can share with friends and family to enhance their internet security.
